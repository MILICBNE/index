    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I went to the following schools:
      <li>Toowong State school (PREP-6)</li>
      Here I was awarded the maths award and where I<br>
      got the idea of learning basketball from a year<br>
      six buddy. Before that, I was playing soccer in<br>
      the Taringa Rovers with school friends. In this<br>
      school I was particularly exelling in the<br>
      following subjects - maths, english, science,<br>
      technology and music.<br>

      <tr>

        <td><p>I started basketball at the age of 7 and was a<br>
            part of a Mini Hoop program. Close to the end of
            the year I joined a club call the West Bribane<br>
            Falcons. I stayed there for a season or two than
            I moved to a closer club called Lang Park.<br>
            There I play to this day. I played there in u11,
            u13, and I am currently playing under 15 division<br>
            one. In 2021, I started playing state level Basketball
            for a team called the Brisbane Capitals <br>u12 gold as a
            bottem aged player. We came forth in the stated as I vowed
            to achieve better. In 2022,<br> I played one more season with
            the u12 however this time we came 3rd after I had a
            clutch last minute to<br> take home the W. Closing
            that year, I trialed for the u14 team and made division
            one. Here I<br> remain playing to this day
